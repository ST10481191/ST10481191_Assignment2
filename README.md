The History Quiz App is an interactive mobile application designed to test and enhance users' knowledge of historical events, figures, and facts. The app makes learning history enjoyable by presenting questions in a quiz format, making it perfect for students, history enthusiasts, or anyone looking to challenge their knowledge.

Purpose and Concept
The idea behind this app is to make studying history less tedious and more engaging. History can sometimes feel like a collection of dates and facts to memorize, but this app turns that around by allowing users to actively participate in a quiz. This way, they learn while having fun.

How It Works
The app is divided into three main sections:

Start Page:

The first screen users see when they open the app. It has a simple “Start” button that directs users to the quiz page. This minimalist design helps users dive straight into the quiz without unnecessary distractions.

Quiz Page:

The core of the app, where users answer a series of history-related multiple-choice questions.

After selecting an answer, the app immediately tells whether it’s correct or not. However, it doesn’t show the total score during the quiz, keeping the focus on learning rather than scoring.

The quiz questions are styled like flashcards to create a classic, educational feel.

Score Page:

After completing the quiz, users are directed to the score page. This page shows the final score, allowing users to see how well they did and identify areas for improvement.

Technology Used
The app is built using Kotlin in Android Studio, with the interface designed in XML. It uses Intents for smooth navigation between the start, quiz, and score pages. The project is structured to be simple, efficient, and user-friendly.

Why Use the History Quiz App?
The app is perfect for anyone who wants to test their historical knowledge while keeping the experience light and engaging. Whether you’re preparing for a history test or just curious about past events, the History Quiz App makes learning easy and enjoyable.
